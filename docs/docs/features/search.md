# Search

Immich uses postgres as the search database.

Postgres with the pgvector extension can integrate with popular natural language processing (NLP) models like CLIP and SBERT to provide highly accurate and relevant search results. Here are some benefits of using CLIP and SBERT:

Improved Search Accuracy: When integrated with CLIP and SBERT, Postgres can leverage the semantic understanding and deep learning capabilities of these models to further improve the accuracy of search results.

Some search examples:
<img src={require('./img/search-ex-2.webp').default} title='Search Example 1' />

<img src={require('./img/search-ex-3.webp').default} title='Search Example 2' />
